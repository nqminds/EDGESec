# How to contribute

This is a project that is hosted on GitHub.
To contribute, you can fork the project and make your own changes.

## Writing Code

We recommend using `pre-commit` to check your contributions before they are committed.

Pre-commit can be installed via pip (requires Python3):

```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
```

Then, you can setup pre-commit in this project using:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
