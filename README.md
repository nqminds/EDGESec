## Build

### Installing Dependencies

On Ubuntu, we need a C compiler, CMake, Doxygen, and libnl libraries:

```bash
sudo apt update
build_dependencies=(
    cmake # build-tool
    doxygen texinfo graphviz # documentation
    build-essential # C and C++ compilers
    libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev # netlink dependencies
    automake # required by libmicrohttpd for some reason?
    autoconf # required by compile_sqlite.sh
    libtool-bin # required by autoconf somewhere
    pkg-config # seems to be required by nDPI
    libjson-c-dev # mystery requirement
    protobuf-compiler
    flex bison
)
runtime_dependencies=(
    dnsmasq
)
sudo apt install -y "${build_dependencies[@]}" "${runtime_dependencies[@]}
```

To install grpc dependencies:
```console
cd lib/
sudo ./compile_grpc_deps.sh
```

### Compile

Compiling EDGESec is done with CMake.

First, configure `cmake` in the `build/` directory by running the following.
(equivalent to `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`)
This is currently very slow, as it compiles all the C programs single-core.

```bash
cmake -B build/ -S .
```

To build, you can then run (`-j4` means 4 jobs/threads, replace `4` with the amount of cores you want to use):
(equivalent to `make -j4`)

```bash
cmake --build build/ -j4
```

After succesful compilation the binary will be located in ```./build/src``` folder.

You can use the following to also install files into `build/edgesec-dist` (equivalent to `make install`):

```bash
cmake --build build/ --target install -j4
```

## Running

To run ```edgesec``` tool with a configuration file ```config.ini``` located in ```./build``` folder use:

```console
./build/src/edgesec -c ./build/config.ini
```

To enable verbose debug mode use:
```console
./build/src/edgesec -c ./build/config.ini -ddddd
```

## Testing

To compile the tests use:

```bash
cmake -B build/ -S .
cmake --build build/ --target test -j4 # or `make test`
```

To run each test individually the test binaries can be located in ```./build/tests``` folder.

## Developer Documentation

To compile the docs from ```./build``` folder:
```console
make doxydocs
```

See [`./docs`](./docs) for how to build the developer doxygen documentation website.
