Description: NquiringMinds EDGESec Network Security Router.
 This is NquiringMind's EDGESec Network Analyser.
 It usually creates a secure and paritioned Wifi access point, using vlans,
 and can analyse network traffic.
 .
 The management of each service is controlled by the tool engine,
 which has the ability to configure and start the execution process.
 .
 First, the engine executes the supervisor service, which has the role
 of registering network joining and DHCP requests.
 It also exposes a command interface in the form of a UNIX domain socket
 that can be used by other application or services the control the connected
 network devices.
 .
 Second, the engine executes the software access point (AP) service that
 creates a managed AP, which allows every network device to connect to it.
 The AP allows setting individual network-joining credentials for each
 connecting device.
 .
 Third, the engine executes the subnet service which creates subnets for
 give virtual LAN (VLAN) IDs and IP ranges. The software AP service maps
 subsequently a connected network device to a subnet.
 .
 Fourth, the engine executes the DHCP service that has the role of assigning
 IP addresses to connected devices.
 .
 Fifth, the engine executes the RADIUS server, which sends access control
 information to the software AP. The access information contains the network
 joining credentials and the accept/deny MAC address information.
 .
 Sixth, the engine execute the state machine service,
 which represents the core of the network monitoring and management process.
 The state machine monitors the state of each connected network device by
 employing information from the supevisor service.
 It also uses the capture service, which executes self contained traffic
 capturing routines to monitor the flow of packet and disect identify the
 device types.
